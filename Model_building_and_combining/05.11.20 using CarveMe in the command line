#today I am going to work on building metabolic models from scratch using CarveMe.
#step 0: pip install carveme into this environment.
#also need to install cplex; the default is (hopefully, according to update release notes) gurobi, but carveme won't
#import without cplex
#step 0.1: pip install cplex
#oh boy, have to get an academic license and everything for this sucker. Great. Stay tuned.
#cplex is now installed (minus the API, which I can't figure out), as is CarveMe

carve Victivallis_vadensis_DSM_14823_protein.faa
#oh. What if this goes in the command line and not in spyder?

#so, computing is terrible and I don't understand what anything is.

#trying this in the terminal. First, start up the MICOM_CRC_FBA_02.2020
#virtual environment and navigate to the correct folder:
#Documents/MICOM_CRC_FBA/Model_building_and_combining/0_genome_seqs_for_model_building
#note that C= pwd prints working directory.

#well, it took about 45 seconds and made a .tsv file: is this useful? I don't know.

#try this: carve Victivallis_vadensis_DSM_14823_protein.faa --output Victivallis_vadensis_DSM_14823.xml

#still getting this error:

    f"Wrong number of items passed {len(self.values)}, "

#don't know what's up here.

#05.13.20 new error: Error: Error opening file Victivallis_vadensis_DSM_14823_protein.faa
Failed to run diamond.

#i pip install(ed) diamond
#this did not help.

#so, according to githubs, this seems like a python2 vs python3 issue. Need to set up a new virtual environment that has python2.7 to deal with this.
